**HTML** ‚Äì For layout and semantic structure
**CSS** ‚Äì Grid layout, tile styling, animations, responsive design
**JavaScript** ‚Äì Game logic, event handling, DOM updates, audio triggers

## Project Overview

This game was developed to reinforce DOM manipulation, modular JavaScript logic, event-driven UI behavior, and
thoughtful UX design. What began as a basic grid quickly expanded into a polished product with dynamic visuals,
sound effects, responsive design, and deeper gameplay mechanics. 

The game includes key features like:

- A simple grid-based UI built with HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox and JavaScript
- Tile interactions (revealing tiles, flagging mines)
- Random mine placement and adjacent mine counting
- Individual tile and flag rendering
- Win/loss detection


## MVP Feature3

#### CSS-Based Animations (Visual Styling)

  - Handled with classes and transitions in .css file and rules that change visual states when certain classes
    are added or removed by JS.
  - Tile Reveal Effects: Beveled to flat look using .revealed class.
  - Tile Explosion Coloring: Mine tiles turn red via .isMine class.
  - Face Emoji Animations: The win/lose faces like üòé and üò≠ were animated by applying CSS classes tied to game state.
  - Hover Effects: For unrevealed tiles to show feedback on cursor movement.
  - Leveraged CSS Grid for the tile board and Flexbox everything else. While technically not responsive (aka not mobile) ready, its playable across a wide variety of screen sizes.
 
### JavaScript-Triggered Animations (DOM Updates)
  - JS was responsible for triggering and coordinating animations.
  - JS adds/removes classes (like .revealed, .isMine) at the correct times.
  - Emoji transitions and message displays (like ‚ÄúYou Win!‚Äù) were triggered in JS based on game events.
  - Cascade Reveal: JavaScript handled per-tile reveals recursively but each reveal triggered a visual update via
    renderTile() ‚Äî giving the illusion of animation as it happened tile-by-tile.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics

  - Full recursive flood reveal on tiles with 0 adjacent mines
  - Mine placement delayed until first left-click
  - All mines revealed on loss; numbers stay hidden to avoid spoilers
  - Win/loss message panel slides into view after game ends
  - Game can be paused/resumed by clicking the face-button
  - Board interaction is disabled after win/loss or while paused
  - DOM updates are modular and fast ‚Äî uses `renderTile()` and `renderFlag()` per tile

### Enhanced Visual & Audio Feedback

 **Emoji face-button** updates based on game state: actively playing, pause üò¥ win üòé loseüò≠
  
 **Sound effects**
    - Click sounds for revealing a tile and placing a flag via rght mouse click
    - Flag placement sound
    - Explosion on mine click
    - Applause on win
  
 **Visuals**:
    - Centered bomb icons
    - Red background on clicked mine
    - Cascading tile reveal animation
    - Flat styling on revealed tiles
    - Emoji burst animations on win/loss

 **UI Counters**:
    - Flag counter (live updates)
    - Mine counter based on dynamic % (20% of board)
    - Incrementing Timer (3-digit, pause/resume supported)

## Future Enhancements
  - Reset Button: Adds a button to restart the game without refreshing the page.
  - Save/Load Game: Allows users to save and load game states for later continuation.
  - Mobile Responsiveness: Optimizes the layout for smaller screen sizes.
  - Floating Game Options Panel for Hint, Undo, Replay options
  - Dynamic Favicon Swap based on game state
  - Dynamically generated board HTML (no hardcoded grid)
  - Difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  - Support for user-chosen board size & mine count
  - Add tile.svg as background image for unrevealed tiles
  - Side panel to display full game rules

## Installation

To run the game locally, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shawnhank/minesweeper.git
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   
   - Double-click the `index.html` file, or open it using your preferred browser to play the game.

## Usage 

1. Left click to reveal / uncover tiles. If a tile contains a mine, the game ends (game over).
2. Flag potential mines: Right-click on a tile to flag it as a suspected mine.
3. Win condition: The game is won if all non-mine tiles are revealed before any mines are clicked.
4. Restart the game: Click the Reset Button or Right Click on the emoji button between the Flag Counter and Timer
5. Pause & Unpase the game by left-clicking on the emoji button as well


## [Gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper)
The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on a grid that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath. The location of most mines is discovered through a logical process, but some require guessing, usually with a 50-50 chance of being correct. Clicking on the game board will reveal what is hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank squares [bordering 0 mines] may be revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other). Some squares are blank while others contain numbers (from 1 to 8), with each number being the number of mines adjacent to the uncovered square.

To help the player avoid hitting a mine, the location of a suspected mine can be marked by flagging it with the right mouse button. The game is won once all blank or numbered squares have been uncovered without hitting a mine.
