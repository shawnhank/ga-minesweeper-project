# Minesweeper Planning Document


# 0. Overview
This Planning Document defines:
* What data needs to exist.
* What events/actions happen.
* What page elements must be built.
* What a tile shows when revealed.
* How the basic game flow will run.
* How win and loss conditions are explicitly handled.

# 1. Data Structures
Each tile (square on the grid) must track:
* isBomb (boolean):
  * True if this tile has a bomb, false otherwise.
* isRevealed (boolean):
  * True if the tile has been clicked (revealed).
* isFlagged (boolean):
  * True if the player flagged this tile.
* adjacentBombs (number, 0‚Äì8):
  * How many bombs are in the 8 neighboring tiles.

‚†ÄThe board (the full grid) is a 2D array (array of arrays) containing all tiles.

# 2. Main User Events
* Left-Click on a Tile
  * If the tile is flagged, do nothing.
  * If the tile has a bomb:
    * Reveal all bombs.
    * Enter "freeze" state.
    * Change face to sad.
  * If the tile does not have a bomb:
    * Reveal the tile.
    * If adjacentBombs = 0, recursively reveal adjacent tiles.
    * Check win condition (after every reveal).
* Right-Click on a Tile
  * If tile is already revealed, do nothing.
  * Toggle the tile's flagged status.
* Click on Face Button
  * Reset the game completely:
    * Create a new board.
    * Randomly place 10 bombs.
    * Reset face to happy.
    * Clear any win/loss state.

# 3.5 Tile Reveal Outcomes 
When a tile is revealed:
* If the tile has a bomb:
  * Display bomb symbol (üí£).
  * (Trigger game over immediately.)
* If the tile does NOT have a bomb:
  * If adjacentBombs > 0:
    * Display the number (1‚Äì8) indicating how many bombs are nearby.
  * If adjacentBombs = 0:
    * Display a blank or cleared tile (no number or symbol).

# 4. Page Elements
* Game Board:
  * 9x9 grid of clickable tiles.
* Face Button:
  * Smiley face at game start.
  * Sad face on loss.
  * Cool face on win.
