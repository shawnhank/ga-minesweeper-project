# Minesweeper MVP Requirements


## Overview
Focus purely on getting the core Minesweeper mechanics working: basic clicking, bomb placement, tile revealing, flagging, win detection, and game reset. All additional features are nice-to-haves once the core experience is solid.

## Core Gameplay (Minimum Requirements)
* Single-player game.
* Grid size: 9 rows × 9 columns (9×9 grid).
* Bomb count: Exactly 10 bombs, placed randomly on the board.

## Tile Behavior
* Left-click to reveal a tile.
  * If bomb → instant loss.
  * If no bomb → reveal number (or blank if 0 bombs nearby).
* Right-click to flag or unflag a tile (for player tracking purposes only).

## Game Outcomes
* Win Condition: Reveal all non-bomb tiles.
* Lose Condition: Click on a bomb.
* Freeze State:
  * After win or loss, grid becomes unclickable.
  * Only the face button remains active to reset the game.

## Face Button
* Always visible.
* Clicking it resets the game.
* (Optional visual change: Smiley face for active play, sad face for loss, cool face for win.)
